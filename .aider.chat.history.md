I'm looking at a Daily Fantasy Sports + Crypto Events Betting League (mix DraftKings with crypto degeneracy). Dessign an onchain daily fantasy sports app on Base focused on crypto events and real sports – users draft teams of memecoins, traders, or athletes; scores based on price performance or real stats. Entry fees in USDC, big prize pools, free-to-play modes, friend leagues, and live leaderboards. Make it a Farcaster mini-app with easy sharing of lineups and trash-talking.
```

Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.

I need the current contents of `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to update the title and description.  
Please add that file to the chat.

A stylized logo featuring a gold coin with a subtle gradient, overlaid with a blue and white soccer ball. The background is a dark navy gradient. The design is bold, modern, and conveys the fusion of crypto and sports for a fantasy league app.
